       <p>Hello, my name is Stephanie and I want to tell you about my summer vacation in Atlanta! 
           This was a girls trip with all my close friends, this was one of the best trips of my life. </p>

           <div>
            <h3>Day 1:</h3>
           <p> Me and my friend Traquil flew in from Kansas City, MO to Atlanta and was greeted by my beautiful
               sister Teqorieya. We went to the beauty salon where I was dolled out by a phenonmenal beautician. 
               After getting a makeover we went to a food chain restaurant called, "Slutty Vegan". Slutty Vegan is 
               a vegan burger spot known for the best vegan burgers. We waited in line 2 hours to try it. I got 
               a sloppy toppy burger, it was a vegan burger with jalepeno's and slutty sauce. It was the BEST vegan
               burger I have ever tasted. It was getting late and we were all tired so we went to my sisters house 
               and took showers, watched tv and went to bed.

            <h3>Day 2:</h3>
           <p> I woke up to the smell of bacon cooking, my sister had made a nice filling breakfast to
               start the day, bacon, eggs, toast, fruit and muffins. It was delicious, that morning Teqorieya
              aka  "TQ", Traquil and I went to the mall, I shopped ENTIRELY TOO MUCH that day. After the mall we 
              went to the airport to pick up my Favorite cousin, Whitney. We rolled up to the the airport and 
              Traquil had a loud bullhorn screaming Whitney's name as she walked to the car. We laughed for at least 
              30 min on the drive back. Whitney never tasted slutty vegan so we were at it again waiting in the long
              line to get those vegan burgers. Afterwards we went to the house and partyed until our other girls arrived
              later that night. At around 11 we were all dancing around the house when the door bell rang and it 
              was my best friend Shannon, Janacea and Rae. They were terrified from their flight. We talked all night
              and eventually went to sleep.

            <h3>Day 3:</h3>
           <p>Today was the most exciting day ever, if you ever seen step brothers, the scene where they
               created a music video on the boat. We reinacted that scene, we woke up early that morning to get 
            to the lake. We all had our swimsuits on and TQ drove the boat. It was sooo fun, after the trip to the 
        lake we went to a club and got food. During our time there we took over the dance floor and all of the girls
    were up on the stage dancing. We had a great time and didn't get home until about 3 am.  </p>

            <h3>Day 4:</h3>
    <p>We got up early and went to church with TQ. It was a nice service and we all enjoyed ourselves.
        Afterwards we went home to change, we decided to wear all white and dress really nice to celebrate
        TQ's birthday. We all pitched in on giving her money and buying her a cake. We left and went to Papadeaux's
        a seafood restaurant. We surprised TQ with her gift there and her husband came in with the cake. She cried
        and we all started to cry. It was one of the most beautiful moments. That was our last day to have fun, so we
        went to the liqour store and bought tons of liquor and partied until the next day.

    <h3>Last Day:</h3>
    <p> Janacea, Shannon, Rae and I had to be at the airport at 5am. So we fell asleep in the car around
        headed to the airport at 5. We made it on time and slept the entire flight home. This was definitely a trip 
        to remember and I look forward to making another one with my friends.
